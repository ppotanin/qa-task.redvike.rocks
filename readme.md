README - Automated Form Testing with Cypress

This repository contains the code for automated testing of a web application with Cypress.io. The application is a simple form that captures user information and has a CAPTCHA slider for verification.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
A web browser (Chrome recommended for Cypress)
Setup
Clone this repository:

Bash
git clone https://your-github-url/automated-form-testing.git


Install dependencies:
moment.js


Bash
cd automated-form-testing
npm install
Use code with caution.
Running Tests
Open a terminal in the project directory.

Start the Cypress test runner:

Bash
npx cypress run
npx cypres open

Use code with caution.
This will open the Cypress test runner in your browser. You can see the test cases listed and run them individually or all together.

Test Cases
This project includes automated test cases for the following scenarios:

Test Case 1: Submit form with valid data and verify successful submission.
Test Case 2: Submit form with invalid data (empty fields, mismatched passwords, incorrect email format) and verify validation errors.
Test Case 3: Attempt form submission without completing the CAPTCHA and verify it's blocked.
Test Case 4: Upload various image types for the avatar and verify successful display on the success page.
Report
The test runner will display the results of each test case, indicating success or failure. You can review the detailed logs for each test to verify the behavior.

Note: This is a basic example, and a more comprehensive report might include additional details like time taken for each test, screenshots on failures, or captured error messages.

Technology Choice
This project uses Cypress.io for automated testing. Cypress is a popular open-source tool for end-to-end web testing. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing tests and interacting with the browser. Cypress is a good choice for this task as it allows for easy automation of user interactions with the web form and CAPTCHA slider.
